    <!--My Biography-->
    <section>
      <h1>Biography</h1>
      My name is <strong>Victor Kwaghfan Wanbua,</strong> a 28-year-old Nigerian
      from Benue State, currently residing in Lagos. I am in my final year at
      the National Open University of Nigeria, where I am pursuing a Bachelor of
      Science in Information Technology through the Open and Distance Learning
      program. Alongside my academic journey, I work full-time while also
      furthering my professional development through AltSchool Africa, where I
      am expanding my knowledge and skills in the tech space. I come from a
      family of four, and I am also a proud husband and father to a young
      daughter. Balancing family, work, and academics has shaped me into a
      disciplined, resilient, and forward-looking individual. My interests lie
      in technology, problem-solving, and continuous learning, with the goal of
      leveraging tech to create impactful solutions and inspire others from
      similar backgrounds.

      <h3>Why AltSchool Africa?</h3>

    <!---Why i joined Altschool Africa-->
    <div>
      I joined AltSchool Africa because I believe it offers the best environment
      for my growth, with its structured learning platform, community of
      like-minded learners, and access to experienced tutors who are committed
      to student success. The fact that the program is 100% remote makes it even
      more valuable to me, as it allows me to balance my full-time work, family
      responsibilities, and studies without compromising on quality learning. My
      goal is to become an exceptional software engineer, with a strong focus on
      cloud computing and modern infrastructure. With the global shift from
      on-site to cloud-based systems, I am determined to gain industry-standard
      skills and hands-on experience that will make me stand out in the job
      market. Coming from a completely different background, I see this as a
      transformative journey, and I am committed to using the knowledge gained
      over the next year to build a solid foundation for a successful career in
      tech.
